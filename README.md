# Dendritic-Branching-GSEA

This notebook contains the annotated computational procedure and analysis for my research on dendritic arborization in cortical mouse neurons. It provides a guide on using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and further downstream computational techniques in Python for transcriptomic data. See the supplmentary materials and images folder to view the original poster associated with this research. Parts of the analysis have since been updated, but the findings reported in the poster remain largely the same.
